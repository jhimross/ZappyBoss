☕ How to Play – Zappy Boss
🎮 The Mission:
Help Boss Arron stay airborne while dodging digital distractions, remote-work chaos, and floating obstacles from the cloud office!

🕹 Controls:
Tap / Click / Press Space to flap and keep Arron flying.

Time your flaps to guide him up and down between obstacles.

Avoid hitting anything — Arron may be the boss, but gravity still wins.

⚠️ Avoid These:
Frozen Zoom screens ❄️

Overflowing coffee mugs ☕

Notification bubbles 💬

Wi-Fi dead zones 📶

Floating office chairs 💺

Angry calendar reminders 📅

🚀 Power-Ups:
Coffee Boost: Temporary speed and energy burst

Delegate Button: Clears all current obstacles (Boss move!)

Mute Shield: Silences distractions and makes you invincible for a few seconds

Auto-Reply Bot: Flies for you briefly while Arron “multitasks”

🎯 The Goal:
Stay alive as long as you can.

Fly farther than your coworkers.

Claim your spot on the leaderboard as the Zappiest Boss Alive!

🤫 Bonus Tip:
Tapping rhythmically is better than smashing your screen. Arron doesn’t need more pressure.
