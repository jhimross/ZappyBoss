# 🚀 Zappy Boss

**Zappy Boss** is a fast-paced, Flappy Bird-style browser game created as an icebreaker for our company’s townhall event! The main character of the game? **Our boss, Arron**! Help him flap through digital distractions, dodge remote work chaos, and stay airborne—because even the boss can't fall on your watch.
